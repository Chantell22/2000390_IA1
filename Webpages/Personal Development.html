					I don't support everyone's prespective but everyone's prespective should be share. It allows me to understand a person, how they think and how

					<p align="center"> <font size="+2" face="Cambria" > Reflection on Chapters 4-7 </font> </p>
					<p> <font face="Cambria"> In Chapters 4-7 of the Twelve Pillars a novel by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, old timer Charlie teaches 
					a younger man named Michael about the twelve pillars of success that he learnt from a gentleman named Mr. Davis.
					Throughout the four Chapters he goes through the four different pillars, goal setting, time management, relationships, and life-long 
					learning. The first advice that Michael is given is about the important of goal setting and ways to effectively set goals.
					In the next chapter Charlie details the importance of time management and the burden of regret in one older life. 
					When the two characters meet again in the next chapter Charlie explains to Michael the importance of relationships on a person. 
					He also details the ways to evaluate one’s relation and three types of relation that one must foster for success. In Chapter 7, 
					the pair continue their conversation by Charlie explaining to Michael the importance of life log self-learning, and reading, 
					to growth, development, and success of an individual.there are critiques to be found within the advice. The first critique is 
					that some of Charlie’s advice is from the lived experience of another person rather than that of his own. 
					Similarly, he fails to provide any concrete goals that he has written down and achieved to prove Mr. Davis’s theory of 
					goal setting. <br/> Regardless, there are numerous ways in which Charlie’s advice could be beneficial to my life.  
					Firstly, the advice on time management is incredibly profound. 	Often, I find myself struggling to prioritize events, 
					obstacles, goals, and situations in my life.Likewise, I could really benefit from the evaluations of my relationships. 
					I tend to be a standoffish, and introverted person and as such I rarely allow myself to embrace new people or possibilities 
					that could benefit simply because I do not want to exert the effort in curating a new relationship.  <font> </p>
