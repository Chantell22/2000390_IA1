					<p align="right"> First off the standard stuff. I am Chantell Warren. I am 23 years old pursuing a bachelors degree at the
					University of Technology in Cybersecurity. I am currently a professional daughter with average grades and too much social 
					anxiety to leave my house. But that't not the good stuff. YOU really want to know who am I? Well...</p>

			<tr> 
				<td valign="top">    
					<p align="right"> Its hard to describe one's self. Am I supposed to say i am kind, hardworking
					and diligent? Everyone's says that though. And maybe these things are true for me too. But I am like a mountain or grass. 
					Sometimes one can't see the beauty in them. But they do exude beauty. They are steady fast, dependeble,
					unmovable but yet able to thrive under harsh conditions. The mountain crumbles, the grass gets trampled but yet they remain.
					Damaged but unmoved. </p> 
				</td>

			<tr>
				<td>
					<p align="right"> Or it could be because I'm Sagittarius &#9808. Blunt, simple, an embodiment of nature and freedom. But then again I don't believe
					in Astrology, afterall I am a Sagittarius, and we're skeptical. <br/>
					But don't leave yet there is more below &#9759 </p>

				<p align="left"> In my opinion personality test are insightful and interesting way to categorise and identify aspects about your behaviour. 
				However, I do not think personality test are completely accurate. Personality tests are mostly dependent on a series of question (usually 60) 
				ranging in degree of certainty which are used to identify the intricates of a personâ€™s personality. But these questions are a self-evaluation. 
				That means that the test subject is directly responsible for the outcome. People can perhaps lie to themselves or repress an idea or emotion. 
				Furthermore, mental trauma and mental illness can cause individuals to become unbalanced in their emotions and perceptions. 
				Thus, whereas personality test is important groundwork their validity is one hundred percent unbased.
